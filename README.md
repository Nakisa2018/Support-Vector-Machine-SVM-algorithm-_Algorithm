# Support-Vector-Machine-SVM-algorithm-_Algorithm
The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is a supervised machine learning model used for classification and regression tasks. It is particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and situations where the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples. In this Project we solved some different example with some DataBases by SVM.
